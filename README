The logseq-integration.vim plugin showcases Vim interactions with Logseq's API and provides easy access to the graph filesystem. It requires the jq command-line tool in the PATH and the definition of the graph path as a global variable.


This plugin can be installed by cloning the repository into Vim's pack/dist/start/ directory. After cloning, the plugin will be available for use, allowing for enhanced integration with Logseq directly from Vim.
